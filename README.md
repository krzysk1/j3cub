# Tip
To start the engine grab the propeller blade and rotate the propeller. When using a mouse drag down instead of around the spinner for the best result.

# Note from A-Pilot

Hi everyone

This is the Piper J-3 Cub, easily one of the most well adored aircraft in history.
I hope you like my X-Plane cub, and enjoy a trip back in time in this wonderful flyer.

Handy hint--there's an annoyingly tiny but helpful engine starter and battery button hidden above and behind you by the left wing root. ;)

FLOAT VERSION: water rudder actuator is down to your right beside and slightly in front of your seat.

The cub now features an animated, working fuel gauge on the nose fuel cap! 

This is FREEWARE! Have fun. If you're going to redistribute it, please give A-Pilot some credit.



ENJOY :)
